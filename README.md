# cli-app

This is a simple Command Line Interface application coded in Golang that uses a third-party package to get the ip address or the servers of a website. The user can use the two commands, "ip" and "servers", and then pass a url. The program will get and display the ip of the website server, or, in the "servers" option, the urls of the servers the website uses. 

I coded this following the tutorial of a Golang course on Udemy, to practice the basic concepts and features of the language.
